# FlickRApp
A Two screen app than shows a list of pictures and an additional screen showing further details for selected picture. 
Uses no 3rd party Apis
Faced some struggles as this was my first time with the FlickR API, alot of methods and json responses to get throught and understand.
Would like to expand on the app to add more search criteria, and author specific searches as well as testing.
